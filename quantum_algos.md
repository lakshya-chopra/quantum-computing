# Quantum Algorithms

Quantum Algorithms are specifically curated for quantum computers to showcase how useful they can be in certain cases, for ex: running classically exponential time programs in polynomial time.

Before you learn this, please revise some common Qubit gates like:
 - Pauli X,Y and Z
 - Hadamard
 - CNOT
 - Toffoli
 - Modified CNOT (which is activated when control Qubit is |0‚ü©)
 - U gate (which can be used to generate an arbitrary qubit)

Let's look at some common Quantum algorithms :
