## lattice based cryptography:
Lattice based cryptography involves constructions of [crypto primitives]( (one which forms the basis for any cryptographic protocol/algorithms) using the mathematical structures, Lattice. This type of constructions are widely used in Quantum safe cryptographic protocols, for ex: CRYSTALS Kyber/Dilithium, Falcon, FrodoKEM(not standardized due to low performance), NTRUEncrypt & SWIFFT. Though not all, still a lot of lattice based constructions are safe from both quantum & classical computers, unlike Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, ECC & RSA.
