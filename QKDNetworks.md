## QKD Networks
These are an addon tech to conventional telecom networks, that can be used to generate, manage & distribute crypt keys among arbitrary QKD Nodes in a secure manner.
QKD networks are divided into several layers, that include:
  - Quantum Layer
  - Key Management Layer
  - Control Layer
  - QKD Network Management Layer
  - Service Layer
The Quantum Layer consists of all the logical links (both quantum & classical) b/w arbitrary QKD nodes, the rest of the layers are summarised in the pic below:
